### **4\. User Responsibilities**

#### **Reporters**

Reporters are expected to use the Service in good faith, providing accurate, truthful, and relevant information in their submissions. By submitting a report, you affirm that the information you provide is, to the best of your knowledge, accurate and not misleading. The Service is intended for serious concerns regarding compliance, ethics, or workplace issues, and should not be used for personal grievances, false accusations, or malicious intent.

Business Admins are responsible for any activity conducted through their account and must promptly notify Secret Contact of any suspected unauthorized access.

### **5\. Data Privacy and Security**

#### **Data Encryption**

Secret Contact prioritizes the security and confidentiality of all data transmitted and stored within the Service. All data submitted through the Portal, including reports and user communications, is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols to ensure that it remains protected from unauthorized access. Notably, Secret Contact does not store decryption keys on its servers, meaning only authorized users within the organization can access and decrypt the data. This approach enhances user privacy and limits access to sensitive information solely to those with the appropriate decryption keys.

#### **Personal Data Collection**

Secret Contact collects limited personal data required to provide the Service effectively and securely:

* **Reporters**: To maintain anonymity, the Service does not collect identifiable personal information from Reporters, except as needed to confirm user access and prevent unauthorized activity (e.g., reCAPTCHA data).  
* **Business Admins**: Business Admins are required to provide certain personal information, such as a valid email address, username, and password, to create and manage their accounts. This information is stored securely and used exclusively for authentication, communication, and management of the Service.

For more details on data handling and user rights, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

#### **Data Storage**

Secret Contact ensures that all data, including reports, user interactions, and audit logs, is securely stored in accordance with applicable data protection standards. Data provided by Business Admins may be stored on the server to facilitate user authentication and account management. However, information related to Reporters is stored in a way that limits access and retains the highest level of confidentiality.

Audit logs and other immutable records are stored in a secure, unalterable format in compliance with data retention and regulatory standards. These logs cannot be deleted and are accessible only to authorized users within the organization and, when required, the owner of the Service.

#### **Cookies and Tracking**

Secret Contact uses cookies solely for necessary operational purposes, including user authentication, service security, and third-party integrations (e.g., Stripe and reCAPTCHA).

* **Session Cookies**: Used for logged-in users (Business Admins) to securely maintain their session on the Service.  
* **Third-Party Cookies**: Certain trusted third parties, such as Stripe for payment processing and Google reCAPTCHA for security validation, may set cookies in line with their own policies to ensure seamless Service functionality.

No cookies are used for marketing or tracking purposes, and all cookies are limited to the minimum required to provide and protect the Service.

### **6\. Data Access and Retrieval**

#### **User Data Requests**

Users have the right to request access to their personal data stored within the Service, in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Business Admins can submit a formal request to view the information associated with their accounts, including any personal information they have provided for account creation and management. Reporters, due to the anonymous nature of their submissions, have limited retrievable data to ensure privacy and confidentiality.

To make a data access request, users may contact Secret Contact’s support team via \[support email/contact method\]. We will verify the identity of the requester and respond within a reasonable timeframe, providing any available personal data in accordance with legal requirements and privacy policies.

#### **Audit Log Access**

For compliance, security, and auditing purposes, Secret Contact maintains immutable records of key activities within the Portal, such as report submissions, access events, and administrative responses. These audit logs are stored in a secure, unalterable format, ensuring transparency and accountability. While these records are not subject to deletion, authorized users within the organization, as well as the owner of Secret Contact, may access these logs as needed. This data is used solely for maintaining service integrity and supporting organizational accountability, and access is tightly controlled.

#### **Anonymity and Control**

The Service is designed to protect the anonymity of Reporters. Reporters have control over the information they choose to provide in their submissions, and Secret Contact does not collect personally identifiable information from Reporters unless explicitly disclosed by the Reporter themselves. Reporters can trust that their submissions will remain confidential and anonymous, enabling a secure environment for disclosing sensitive information without fear of exposure.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Secret Contact disclaims all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from or related to the use of the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, damages resulting from data loss, unauthorized access, service interruptions, or third-party interference, whether such events arise from user negligence, misuse, or actions beyond Secret Contact’s control.

Secret Contact provides the Service on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We make no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of the Service or any data stored or transmitted within it. Secret Contact does not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

Users are responsible for implementing appropriate security, backup, and recovery measures within their own systems. Secret Contact shall not be liable for any damages resulting from user negligence, failure to follow security best practices, or actions taken by third parties.

In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, Secret Contact’s liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

### **10\. Dispute Resolution**

#### **Governing Law**

These Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law principles. By using the Service, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Texas for the resolution of any disputes.

#### **Dispute Resolution Process**

In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Service, you agree to first attempt to resolve the matter through informal negotiation by contacting Secret Contact at \[support email/contact method\]. Both parties agree to make a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute informally within 30 days of initial contact.

If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, the parties agree to binding arbitration as the exclusive method of dispute resolution. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted in Texas unless both parties agree to a different location.

Both parties waive their right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit in connection with any claims arising from these Terms. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses in the arbitration, except as otherwise required by the AAA rules or applicable law.
